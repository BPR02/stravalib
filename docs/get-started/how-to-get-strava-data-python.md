# How to get your data from the Strava API using Python and stravalib

In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up your Strava API application using **Stravalib** and Python to access data from Strava's V3 REST API. You'll also learn how to refresh your token when needed after setting up authentication.

## Set up Strava API authentication

Authentication involves 4 steps:

1. **Create a Developer App**:
   Start by creating a free developer "app" in your Strava account. This app will be your main connection to the Strava API.

2. **Set Up Authentication**:
   You'll configure the authentication process by setting up permissions, known as "scopes." Scopes determine what your app can accessâ€”-whether it's just reading data or making changes to the data online on behalf of a user (or you).

3. **Log In and Authorize**:
   When you log in to Strava and approve the permissions, Strava will give you a special code. This code is used to request an access token from Strava.

4. **Use and Refresh the Access Token**:
   The access token allows your app to interact with Strava. It's valid for 6 hours. After that, you can refresh it using {py:func}`stravalib.Client.refresh_token()` as often as needed to continue accessing the API.

You only need to complete steps 1-3, once-- especially if you save the refresh_token values somewhere safe. Once steps 1-3 are complete, all you need to do in the future is refresh your token whenever it expires to keep interacting with the Strava API.

:::{note}
This example workflow is a local workflow that doesn't rely upon a web application tool tool like Flask. If you are interested in using Flask, we have a demo folder that provides a basic setup in the `examples/strava-oath` directory of the stravalib GitHub repository.
:::

```python
# You will use this to login to your Strava account
import webbrowser

from stravalib.client import Client

# Open the secrets file and store the client ID and client secret as objects, separated by a comma
# Read below to learn how to set up the app that provides you with the client ID
# and client secret
client_id, client_secret = open("client_secrets.txt").read().strip().split(",")

# Create a client object
client = Client()
# Define your scope (this is read-only - see below for a "write" example which
# allows you to update activities and publish new activities to your Strava account).
# read_all allows read access for both private and public activities
request_scope = ["read_all", "profile:read_all", "activity:read_all"]

# Create a localhost URL for authorization (for local development)
redirect_url = "http://127.0.0.1:5000/authorization"
# This is your scope - read-only in this case
request_scope = ["read_all", "profile:read_all", "activity:read_all"]
# Create url to use - notice that your app client_id is included in your
# authorization url
url = client.authorization_url(
    client_id=client_id,
    redirect_uri=redirect_url,
    scope=request_scope,
)

# Open the URL in a web browser (this is where you login and accept the scope
# read vs write) of access to your Strava account data
webbrowser.open(url)

print(
    """You will see a url that looks like this. """,
    """http://127.0.0.1:5000/authorization?state=&code=12323423423423423423423550&scope=read,activity:read_all,profile:read_all,read_all")""",
    """Copy the values between code= and & in the url that you see in the
 browser. """,
)
# Using input allows you to copy the code into your Python console
# (or Jupyter Notebook)
code = input("Please enter the code that you received: ")
print(
    f"Great! Your code is {code}\n"
    "Next, I will exchange that code for a token.\n"
    "I only have to do this once."
)

# Exchange the code returned from Strava for an access token
token_response = client.exchange_code_for_token(
    client_id=client_id, client_secret=client_secret, code=code
)

token_response
# Example output of token_response
# {'access_token': 'value-here-123123123', 'refresh_token': # '123123123',
# 'expires_at': 1673665980}

# Get current athlete details
athlete = client.get_athlete()
# Print athlete name :) If this works your connection is successful!
print(f"Hi, {athlete.firstname} Welcome to stravalib!")

# You can also start exploring stats
stats = client.get_athlete_stats()
stats.all_run_totals.count
```

Below you will get a detailed overview of the above steps. You will also learn how to
refresh your access token. You can only use a new token for 6 hours; then it needs to be refreshed.

## Step 1: create a developer app in your Strava account

First, you will need to create a free developer application in
your Strava account.
[Click here and follow Strava's steps to create a developer
application.](https://developers.strava.com/docs/getting-started/#account)

The figures below are from the Strava setup link provided above. They show you:
1. The Strava application setup screen and
2. The Strava application, once it's been set up with the client ID and access token values.

Figure from the Strava documentation showing the application settings. You can
name your application whatever you wish. You can add any website URL if you are grabbing your data locally. For this tutorial, use `localhost` for the Authorization Callback
Domain if you are only using this locally. Otherwise, you likely have a website
URL that will enter here.

:class: myclass

<img src="https://developers.strava.com/images/getting-started-1.png" alt="Image showing the application and application client secret, access token and refresh token." class="bg-primary mb-1" width="700px">

Figure from the Strava documentation showing the application settings. This screenshot shows the final application you should have once you follow the
steps above. Notice that you can see the access token scope and expiration time and date on the app page. These are values that you will work with below. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client secret** to a file
(see below for more).
:::

:::{important}
Remember to store your client ID and client secret values somewhere safe.
Do not EVER commit secrets or token values to `.git` or push it to GitHub (unless you have
encrypted it)!
:::

## Save your secret and access token values in a text file

Notice that there is a client secret (hidden
in the screenshot) and a token in the first screenshot above. Below, you will copy both
values to a text file to use (and reuse) in your code.

Do the following:

* Create a `client_secrets.txt` file.
* Add the client secret and access token values on a single line separated
by a comma in the format that you see below:

`secret_value_here, access_token_value_here`


:::{note}
The format described above is not required for a Strava workflow. This is just an example of how to store relevant information that you will need to reuse if you intent to update the data in your workflow regularly. If you are creating a web application, you should store this information
securely somewhere in your application's database or web infrastructure.
:::

## Step 2: Setup authentication with Strava

Once you have created your `client_secrets.txt` file, you are ready to setup
authentication using **Python**.

At the top of your code, import the {py:class}`stravalib.client.Client` class.
In this tutorial you will also import `webbrowser` to launch a web browser from your code to
login to Strava. `webbrowser` behaves similar to a web application.

:::{tip}
If you were using Flask, you'd create an HTML template. See our example in the GitHub repo.
:::

```python
# Use webbrowser to launch a browser from Python
import webbrowser

from stravalib.client import Client
```

Next, read the `client_id` and `access_token` from the `client_secrets.txt` file that you created earlier. Then, create a **stravalib** `Client()` object.

The `Client()` object is what you'll use to interact with Strava. It stores your authentication details and provides methods to:

* Retrieve different types of data from Strava, such as activities and club data.
* Modify activity and club data on Strava (if you have a token with write permissions).

You will learn more about read vs. write token scopes below.

```python
# Read the client_id and access_token from the secrets file
client_id, access_token = open("client_secrets.txt").read().strip().split(",")

# Create a stravalib Client() object
client = Client()
```

In this example, the client_id and access_token are read from the client_secrets.txt file. The .strip() method removes any extra spaces, and .split(",") separates the two values. You then create a Client() object from stravalib, which will be used to interact with the Strava API and manage your data.

## Step 3: Login and authorize Strava to interact with your code

Now that you have your developer app created, it's time to authenticate with Strava.

1. You have the client secret and token from your Strava account's developer app, and
2. You have the `Client()` object from **stravalib**.

### Create a URL to Authenticate and Define the Token Scope

Next, you'll define the scope of your authentication (what permissions you need) and set up a redirect URL.

1. **Define the Scope**:
   The scope determines what permissions your app will have when interacting with Strava. If you only need to **read** your data, a read-only scope is enough. However, if you want to **write** data (e.g., upload or create activities), you'll need to request write permissions.

2. **Set a Redirect URL**:
   After you log in to Strava and approve the scope permissions, Strava will redirect you to a specific URL. This is the `redirect_url` you need to define. If you're just authenticating on your local machine to access your own data, you can use something simple like `localhost` for the `redirect_url`.

```{tip}
If you are building an app, then your redirect URL might be the
url of your app.
```

### Set your authentication scope & create a redirect url

## Defining the Scope for Strava API Access

When working with Strava's API, you need to define the permissions, or **scope**, for your application. The scope determines what your app can access or modify. If you only want to **download** your data, you can use read-only permissions.

### Example scope values for read-only access

The example below shows a Python list that defines read-only access. This scope allows your application to access a user's profile and activity data without modifying anything:

```python
# Read-only scope values
request_scope = ["read_all", "profile:read_all", "activity:read_all"]
```

### Example scope values for read and write access

If you need to upload data to Strava (e.g., creating or modifying activities), you must include a write scope. Hereâ€™s an example of a scope that includes both read and write permissions:

```python
# Read and write scope values
request_scope = ["read_all", "profile:read_all", "activity:write", "activity:read_all"]
```

By including activity:write, your app will be able to upload activities or modify existing data on Strava.

:::{tip}
[Learn more about request scope options from the Strava docs here.](https://developers.strava.com/docs/authentication/#details-about-requesting-access)
:::

In this tutorial you will limit your scope to **read-only** as you are only
looking at data in this tutorial rather than modifying it.

You also set the `redirect_url` to **localhost** (to be opened on your computer
locally) url:

```python
# This is a localhost url
redirect_url = "http://127.0.0.1:5000/authorization"
# This is your scope - read-only in this case
request_scope = ["read_all", "profile:read_all", "activity:read_all"]
# Create URL to use - notice that your client_id is included in your authorization URL
url = client.authorization_url(
    client_id=client_id,
    redirect_uri=redirect_url,
    scope=request_scope,
)
```

Your URL will look something like this:

```python
print(url)

# 'https://www.strava.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=123456&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A5000%2Fauthorization&approval_prompt=auto&response_type=code&scope=read_all%2Cprofile%3Aread_all%2Cactivity%3Aread_all'
```

## Time to Put the Above into Action

Now that you've created your Strava authentication URL, you're ready to use it to get permission to access Strava data via the API.

In this section, you'll use Python's `webbrowser.open` method to:

1. Open the URL in a web browser directly from your Python code.
2. Authenticate with Strava (log in and allow your app to access the developer app you created earlier).
3. After authentication, if you're working locally (and not building a web app), Strava will redirect you to a "page not found" screen with a long URL. This might look like an error, but don't worry! The URL contains the code you need to complete authentication.

    The URL will look something like this:
    ```text
    http://127.0.0.1:5000/authorization?state=&code=xxxxxxxxxxx&scope=read
    ```

4. Copy the value between **code** and the **&** symbol. The `xxxxxxxxxxx` in the example represents the code you'll need to authenticate with the API.

Now you're ready to use this code to authenticate!

```python
# Open the url that you created above in a web browser
webbrowser.open(url)
print(
    """You will see a URL that looks like this:
    http://127.0.0.1:5000/authorization?state=&code=12323423423423423423423550&scope=read,activity:read_all,profile:read_all,read_all
    Copy the values between code= and & in the URL that you see in the browser."""
)
# Using input allows you to copy the code into your Python console (or Jupyter Notebook)
code = input("Please enter the code that you received: ")

print(
    f"Great! Your code is {code}\n"
    "Next, I will exchange that code for a token.\n"
    "I only have to do this once."
)
```

You only need to get a code from Strava once.

Next, you exchange the code for an access token. After this, you can refresh the token as often as needed to continue accessing your data.

In the example below, you'll exchange the code for a token using {py:func}`client.exchange_code_for_token()`. The token response contains both an access token (valid for 6 hours) and a refresh token, which you will use to get a new access token once the current one expires.

You can save the token response using Python's `pickle` module so that you can reuse the refresh token later without going through the authentication process again.

```python
token_response = client.exchange_code_for_token(
    client_id=client_id, client_secret=client_secret, code=code
)

# Save the token response locally
with open(path_to_save, "wb") as f:
    pickle.dump(token_response, f)

print("Token saved - hooray!")

# Access and refresh tokens
access_token = token_response["access_token"]
refresh_token = token_response["refresh_token"]  # Use this after 6 hours
```

## Step 4: Use and refresh your Strava API token

Strava provides you with an access token that is good for 6 hours. You can refresh the token as needed if you wish to grab
more data after that 6-hour window has ended.


You can refresh the token using the
{py:func}`client.refresh_access_token()` method.

Earlier, you saved the `refresh_token` and `expires_at` values to a pickle file. You can use that pickle file to refresh the token as many times as needed. Each time, you'll ask Strava for a new token that will allow you to access the API for another 6 hours.

```python
# Open the token object that you saved locally earlier
with open(token_path_pickle, "rb") as f:
    tokens = pickle.load(f)

refresh_response = client.refresh_access_token(
    # This data was saved above in a secrets.txt file
    # Remember to never commit this file to .git!
    client_id=client_id,
    client_secret=client_secret,
    # this token value is accessed from the pickle file you saved above
    refresh_token=refresh_token,
)

# Check that the refresh worked by grabbing the athlete details
client.get_athlete()
```


```python
from stravalib import Client

client = Client()
token_response = client.refresh_access_token(
    client_id=MY_STRAVA_CLIENT_ID,
    client_secret=MY_STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET,
    refresh_token=last_refresh_token,
)

# The client access token should be the same as the newly refreshed token
print(client.access_token)
print(token_response["access_token"])
```

 directory for an example Flask application for fetching a Strava auth token.
